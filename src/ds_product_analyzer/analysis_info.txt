Good — this is the right question.

You don’t find “trending products.”

You detect products that have trend attributes.

Here’s a structured framework you can actually build into a scoring model.

🔥 I. Demand Acceleration Features (Early Signal)

These tell you something is starting to move.

1️⃣ Search Growth Velocity

Source:

Google Trends

Amazon search volume tools

Features to track:

7-day growth %

30-day growth %

Slope of trendline

Consecutive week increases

“Breakout” label (Google)

Key metric:

Acceleration = (Last 7-day avg - Previous 7-day avg) / Previous 7-day avg


You want:

Sustained growth

Not 1-day spike

2️⃣ Social Velocity (Virality Indicators)

Source:

TikTok

Instagram

Pinterest

Features:

Hashtag growth rate

% increase in videos using keyword

Average views per video

Creator diversity (not just 1 influencer)

Power metric:

Velocity Score = (New posts last 7 days / Prior 7 days)


If it doubles → early-stage growth.

💰 II. Monetization Validation Features

Trend ≠ profitable.

These confirm buyers are actually paying.

3️⃣ Ad Longevity

Source:

Meta Ad Library

TikTok Ads Library

Features:

Days ad has been running

Engagement growth over time

Number of duplicate creatives

Strong signal:

21+ days running = likely profitable

45+ days = very strong validation

4️⃣ Review Velocity

Source:

Amazon

AliExpress

Etsy

Features:

Reviews added in last 30 days

Review growth rate %

Rating consistency

Why this matters:
Review growth = real purchases.

🧠 III. Psychological & Product Attributes

These matter more than raw data.

Trending products often share structural traits.

5️⃣ “Scroll-Stopping” Factor

Binary feature:

Can it be demonstrated in 3 seconds?

Is the benefit visually obvious?

Example traits:

Transforms something

Fixes visible problem

Before/after effect

6️⃣ Problem Intensity

Score product on:

Pain relief (high)

Time saving (medium-high)

Vanity enhancement (high)

Entertainment (medium)

Convenience (medium)

Pain > convenience in performance.

7️⃣ Price Sweet Spot

Most winning dropship items:

$20–$60 retail

Lightweight

Cheap to ship

Not electronics-heavy (unless margin high)

Add binary flags:

Under 1 lb

Under $10 landed cost

3x markup possible

📈 IV. Saturation & Competition Features

You need to subtract points too.

8️⃣ Store Saturation

Features:

Number of Shopify stores selling same SKU

Number of identical creatives

Generic AliExpress photos everywhere

High saturation = lower opportunity score.

9️⃣ Trend Shape Pattern

Look at Google Trends curve.

Bad shape:

Sharp spike → fast drop (fad)

Good shape:

Gradual consistent incline

You can quantify this using:

Standard deviation

Spike ratio

Trend smoothness

🧮 V. Composite Trend Score Example

Here’s how you’d structure it.

Trend Score =
0.30 × Search Acceleration
+ 0.20 × Social Velocity
+ 0.20 × Ad Longevity
+ 0.15 × Review Growth
+ 0.10 × Problem Intensity Score
- 0.15 × Saturation Score


Anything > 70 = manual review.

🧠 VI. Advanced Features (Edge Layer)

If you want to go deeper:

1️⃣ Sentiment Mining

Scrape TikTok comments:

“Where do I buy?”

“Need this”

“Link?”

High purchase intent phrases = strong signal.

2️⃣ Category Cluster Growth

Instead of tracking product,
track niche growth.

Example:
“Posture correction”
“Cold therapy”
“Desk ergonomics”

Category-level growth often precedes product explosion.

3️⃣ Seasonality Coefficient

Is it:

Evergreen

Seasonal spike

Event-driven (e.g., back to school)

You don’t want something that dies in 3 weeks unless you’re fast.
